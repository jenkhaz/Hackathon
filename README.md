# Personality Traits and Smoking Behavior Analysis

This repository explores the relationship between personality traits, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle variables, and smoking behaviors in a dataset of approximately 200 participants. The primary focus is on predicting outcomes such as the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CigsPerDay), time to first cigarette (TimeToFirstCig), and related patterns.

## Project Overview

The analysis includes:
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Translation of Arabic responses to English.  
  - Dropping columns that are not suitable for encoding (free-text comment fields).  
  - Renaming columns for clarity and convenience.
  - Label encoding categorical features and ensuring numeric columns remain as is.

- **Feature Selection:**  
  Using simple correlation thresholds (e.g., `abs(corr) >= 0.1` or `0.2`) to select features related to the target variables.

- **Modeling Approaches:**  
  Experiments with several models, including:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - XGBoost Classifier  
  - Attempts at hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.

- **Targets Modeled:**
  - **CigsPerDay:** Categories of cigarettes smoked daily.
  - **TimeToFirstCig:** An indicator of nicotine dependence, measured by how soon after waking a participant smokes their first cigarette.
  - **Social Media Usage:** Attempts to predict the extent of social media usage.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy, Confusion Matrices, and Classification Reports to assess model performance.
  - Cross-validation to evaluate model stability.

## Key Findings

- **Modest Accuracy (~50-56%)**:  
  Despite using advanced models like XGBoost and performing hyperparameter tuning, the predictive performance remained modest.

- **Small Dataset (~200 Data Points)**:  
  The datasetâ€™s limited size likely hinders model generalizability and stability, as complex human behaviors like smoking patterns are difficult to capture with so few samples.

- **Complex, Multifaceted Behaviors:**  
  The complexity of human behavior around smoking, influenced by personality, socioeconomic factors, and lifestyle, cannot be easily captured by a limited set of features and samples.

## Recommendations & Future Work

- **More Data:**  
  Increasing the sample size is crucial to improve statistical power and capture a broader range of behaviors.

- **Feature Engineering & Domain Expertise:**  
  Incorporating domain knowledge, creating more informative features, or collecting additional variables could yield stronger predictive signals.

- **Advanced Modeling Techniques:**  
  Exploring ordinal models for TimeToFirstCig or trying different machine learning algorithms, ensembles, or deep learning approaches may uncover improvements.

## Repository Structure

- **Data:**  
  Contains the original and processed CSV files (if publicly shareable).

- **Notebooks:**  
  Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing steps, model training, tuning, and evaluations.

- **Scripts:**  
  Python scripts for cleaning data, encoding columns, running models, and generating reports.

- **Results:**  
  Saved confusion matrices, classification reports, and summary tables for reference.
